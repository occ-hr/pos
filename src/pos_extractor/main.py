"""
Main entry point for the POS extractor application.
This module orchestrates the end-to-end process of part-of-speech (POS) extraction
from text files located in a specified input directory. It performs the following steps:
    1. Validates the input directory path.
    2. Extracts eligible file paths from the directory.
    3. Chunks file contents for batch processing.
    4. Loads categorization rules for POS tagging.
    5. Builds a custom NLP pipeline with rule injection.
    6. Runs POS extraction and displays sample results.
The pipeline is modular, leveraging components for validation, extraction, chunking,
rule loading, NLP pipeline construction, and POS tagging.
Intended for use as a standalone script or as part of a larger NLP processing workflow.
